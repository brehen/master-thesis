# Ethical Hacking

#### Example question: 
> What are the differences between ethical and non-ethical hacking?

Answer:
```
Ethical hacking: 
Legally agreed through a contract, as opposed to illegal activity.
Promotes security vs stealing information and alter data
Maps out all vulnerabilities, rather than finding weakest link
No harm done vs gloves off
All steps are documented vs no documentation
Final report and presentation vs hiding clues
```

## What is ethical hacking?

Ethical hacking is a subset in the field of hacking. I think it can be summarised into: `Combat unethical hacking`.

`Why do we need ethical hacking?`

- Computer systems are written by humans, and that generally implies that these systems will also include security problems. These problems are spawned by a plethora of reasons:
	- Lack of funding
	- Lack of time
	- Lack og expertise
	- Negligence
	- Convenience
	- Outdated systems
	- Too complex systems
	- Reliance on 3rd party components

`Why is ethical hacking necessary?`

By putting ourself in an attackers perspective, might give you keen insight into security issues you normally wouldn't think of
while developing/testing software. 

The security of a system can't be guaranteed without deep and regular penetration testing. Albeit impossible to always be secure from pentesting alone, appropriate mitigation is the desired result.

`What motivates hacking`

- Clout
- "Because I can" attitude
- Monetary motivation
- Revenge
- Trolling
- Protesting
- Organised groups with specific targets.

`The goal of hacking ðŸŽ¯`

To break the information security triple:
`CONFIDENTIALITY`, `INTEGRITY`, `AVAILABILITY`


`Type of hackers`

- Black hats: Malicious intent
- White hats: Pentesting to promote security
- Script kiddies: amateurs
- Protesters: f.ex anonymous
- Grey hats: Usually white hat, but can turn to the dark side
- Red hats: Stops black hats by attacking them
- Blue hats: Hacks for revenge
- Green hats: Beginners to hacking (me)

`Differences between ethical and non-ethical hacking`

- Legal (Contract) vs Illegal
- Promote security vs Steal information/alter data
- Find all vulnerabilities vs Find the weakest link
- No harm vs Gloves off
- Document all activities vs No documentation
- Final presentation and report vs No report and cleaning all clues

`How to hack`
- Gather information about target
- Identify the target domain
- Find weaknesses
- Exploit weaknesses
- Lateral movements
- Carry out the goal

`Detailed hacking plan`
1. Collect all available information about the target, and synthesise the information into a targeted attack
2. Gather technical information: Network and system specific information, like ip ranges and domains/subdomains
3. Identify available hosts in target network
4. Identify available services in target network `nmap`
5. Manually map the services
6. Automatic vulnerability scanning
7. Manual verification of the findings
8. Exploitation
9. Lateral movements through the network
10. Ensure access until the end
11. Collect info - achieve primary and secondary goals
12. Remove clues
13. Reporting and presentation
14. Remove attacking files

`Type of ethical hacking projects`
Attackers POV:
- External pen testing
- Web hacking
- Internal pen testing
- Wireless pen testing
- Social engineering

From attacker's access POV:
- Black box testing
- Grey box testing
- White box testing

`Methods to do information gathering`
- Google
	- Simple search engine queries
	- Specific engine queries
	- Check cached data in archives
- Social media
- LinkedIn/Company web site
- Create personal and company profiles
- Identify key personell and key information
