## Situations that can be the basis of social engineering attacks
## Social engineering attack types with examples
- Human based
	- Impersonating as someone
	- Eavesdropping
	- Shoulder surfing
	- Dumpster diving
	- Piggybacking
- Computer based
	- Phishing
	- Spear phishing
	- Fake software
## Phishing and spear phishing

Phishing is a form of computer based social engineering attacks that attempt to lure people into disclosing sensitive information, often based in the situations mention above. An example of this is fake login forms that trick people into providing username and passwords. This can either be used to outright steal the credentials, but also be used to hijack session variables in case of mfa login situations.

Spear phishing is essentially the same as phishing, but keenly more focused on specific targets, rather than a wide net intended to hit as many as possible.
