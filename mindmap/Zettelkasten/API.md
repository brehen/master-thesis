# API

Stands for Application Programming Interface. Generally speaking it's an interface between a user (usually a developer) and a system of some sort. 

We can generally split any API into [[Public API]]'s, what other systems hook into to integrate with your system, and [[Private API]]'s which is the behind the scenes of how the system actually works.
