## Notes

### Values, references and mutation (Rust)

In Rust, we have 3 types to think about

- Value, the thing itself
  - Only one value owner
  - If the object implements `copy` it can be implicitly copied
- Reference, a reference to a value
  - You can have as many references as you like. Shorthand:
    `let x = 5; let y = &x`
    - Referencing a value, `moves` the pointer to the value to the new
      reference.
- Mutable reference, a reference to a value that you can also [[mutate]]
  - You `can't` have a mutable reference to a value that is already referenced
    at the same time.

### Types, structs and traits

Types look similar across the three languages, but are written slightly
differently.

In [[Go]], types are generally defined like so:

```go
type Point struct {
  x int
  y int
}

type Line struct {
  p1 *Point
  p2 *Point
}
```

In [[Rust]]:

```rust
struct Point {
  x: i32,
  y: i32,
}

struct Line {
  x: Point,
  y: Point,
}
```

In [[TypeScript]]:

```ts
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

type Line = {
  p1: Point;
  p2: Point;
};
```

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // Important
struct Point {
  x: i32,
  y: i32
}
```

[[TypeScript project structure]]

```ls
node_modules/
src/
.configrc.json
package.json
.config2rc.cjs
...etc
```

[[Golang project structure]]

```ls
cmd/
  main.go
pkg/
  export_name/
  thing.go
 ...
...
go.mod
```

[[Rust project structure]]

```
src/
  bin/
    binary_1.rs
    binary_2.rs
    ...
  lib.rs
  file_1.rs
  errors.rs
target/
  ... build stuff ...
Cargo.toml
```

[[1673971459-rust-enums|Rust enums]]

In Rust, you can write [[1673971551-enums|enums]] like so:

```rust
pub enum Operation {
  Print,
  Add,
  Remove
}
```

This is comprised of several facets. First of all, with the prefixed `pub`, we
can assume it will be publically available and can be imported like:

`TODO: Find out how to import enum`

Then followed by `enum` and the name of the enum, usually uppercased.

Then in the code you reference it like so:

```rust
if(A === Operation.Print) do ehm // TODO: WHAT IS THIS
```

Furthermore, you can even pimp these enum properties with macros, and generics:

```rust
pub enum Operation{
  Print(Option<String>), // <- Specifiy that the Print can be an optional String
  Add((String, String)), // <- Specifiy that the type has to be a tuple of strings
  Remove(String), // <- Specify that the type has to be a String
```

Note to self: I have decided to ignore the go and typescript parts, and just watch the rust videos. I already know a lot of TypeScript, and I have no desire to write Go.


#### [[Rust testing]]

Testing in rust is `fantastic`, according to the Prime. Not sure if I agree yet, but I'm willing to hear him out. Testing in JS-land is not optimal by any measure.

How to write a test in rust:
```rust
#[cfg(test)] // Macro that sets up the following `object`/whatever to be a test.
mod test {
	#[test] // Macro that `injects` the magic that's required to support a test.
	fn test_a_function() {
		exp
	}
}
```


#### [[Rust pattern matching]]

Pattern matching is a great feature in programming languages, that is also present in Rust.

Example:

```rust
let Some(p) = curr 
```


### Project: CLI app, "projector"

Description: Print out all environments in current path

\[ cli opts \] -> \[ Project config \] +-> \[print \] -> \[display\] | +->
\[add\] -> \[save\] | +-> \[rm\] -> \[save\]

CLI arg parsing

#### Node

package: commaind-line-args

#### Golang

package: argparse

#### Rust

package: clap
