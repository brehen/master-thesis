## Abstract

```text
Data centers energy demand is increasing. While a great deal of effort has been made to reduce the amount of CO2 generated by large cloud providers, too little has been done from the application perspective.
We claim that application developers can impact the environmental footprint by enhancing the application design with additional features.
Following the proposed Sustainable Application Design Process (SADP), the application design is enriched with information that can be leveraged by cloud providers to manage application execution in an energy-aware manner.
This exploratory work aims to emphasize the awareness on the sustainability of applications by proposing a methodology for its evaluation.
To this end, we first suggest possible actions to enrich the application design towards sustainability, and finally describe how this additional information can be leveraged in the application workflow.
We discuss the feasibility of our methodology by referring to existing tools and technologies capable of supporting the design features proposed in a production environment.
