## Notes:

####  Let's start coding
-   Remember to separate your API from your implementation. My convention is to put the API in the top-level `lib/` directory, and the implementation below that.
    
-   [[defdelegate]] is a fantastic way to ensure this separation.
    
-   [[alias]] does more than save you typing—it also lets you decouple your code from actual module names.
    
-   Maps are a good way of representing state. [[defstruct]] can be used to make the structure static, predefining the keys and the default values.
