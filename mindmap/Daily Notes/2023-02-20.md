First daily note of the thesis work. Currently sitting in the heart of Bangkok and mustering up the will to start reading some papers. Have a meeting with the supervisors in a few hours with not much to show since our last meeting. I set my ambition too high for actually getting anything worthwhile done during the first week of this vacation.

I did manage to rewrite some of the project description however, and attempted to align the motivation and learning outcomes more with my initial quote from Solomon Hykes.

I've also set up this obsidian "mind castle" with the intent to gather all the notes, thoughts and reflections I stumble across during the next year and a half, while researching and writing the master thesis. 

I'll try to consume the paper "Towards Greener Applications" before the meeting, but we're also going out for a trip to the barber, so I'm not sure how far I'll get.
