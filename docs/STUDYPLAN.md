# Study plan

This document is part of my initial thoughts on writing a Master Thesis at UiO.
Joachim and Michael @ Programming Technology urged me to start writing this
document, so that I can get started with something.

In this document I will attempt to summarise our discussions and try to land a
temporary topic and description for a Master Thesis due the summer of 24.

## Initial suggestion

Modern software systems' business requirements are pushing systems architecture
towards the cloud. It is not uncommon to do so by extending applications'
functionality to include a web-API, and then deploy the server on a virtual
machine (running server editions of e.g Ubuntu or Windows). Then a "frontend"
program is written, often in a different programming language, to call the
application remotely. However, cloud native applications can make radically more
efficient choices in all regards.

The topic of this thesis, is to investigate advanced options for cloud native
web application developers. And could include

## Motivation

> If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker.
> That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of
> computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let's hope
> WASI is up to the task!
