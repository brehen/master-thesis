# master-thesis

This repository contains everything related to my master thesis

My plan for its content:

- Any code that I write to perform research.
- A journal written in Obsidian for research and daily notes to keep track of
  everything I find relevant for the thesis.
- The actual thesis.

As of today (26th of January), the only substantional information here is stored
in the [Project description](/docs/PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md)
