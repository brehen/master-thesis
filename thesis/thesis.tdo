\contentsline {todo}{Feedback from Michael: When I write this, use it to point the reader to the most important parts of the thesis. Avoid listing the chapters; you already have a table-of-contents.}{4}{section*.11}%
\contentsline {todo}{Consider this feedback from Michael: Google also does not make it rain more. If Google come and buys all the green energy in the area, it will just mean that others will use more black energy. They don't build new infrastructure. And this is only for Googles "usage". Not the users and network infrastructure.}{13}{section*.16}%
\contentsline {todo}{Feedback fra ingvild: include that data centers also increase the demand for power, so more power demand => more nature gets torn down to accomadate for the increase in demand.}{14}{section*.17}%
\contentsline {todo}{elaborate on why zwave is relevant. In the end, I ended up relying on modbus because the latency the smart sockets supported were 1s at minimum}{25}{section*.23}%
\contentsline {todo}{I ended up not using this in my final project, but I still spent considerable time getting it to work. Should I just cut it out and focus on modbus tcp, or keep it in the background?}{26}{section*.24}%
\contentsline {todo}{Aknowledge that WASI allows for access to underlying system, but the experiments will focus on running pure functions, which kinda diminishes this point.}{31}{section*.26}%
\contentsline {todo}{elaborate that the functions chosen are to be Pure, meaning that Nebula in its current state has been used a PFaaS (pure functions as a service)}{32}{section*.27}%
