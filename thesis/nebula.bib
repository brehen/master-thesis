  abstract = {WebAssembly has emerged as a low-level language for the web and beyond. Despite its popularity in different domains, little is known about WebAssembly binaries that occur in the wild. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of 8,461 unique WebAssembly binaries gathered from a wide range of sources, including source code repositories, package managers, and live websites. We study the security properties, source languages, and use cases of the binaries and how they influence the security of the WebAssembly ecosystem. Our findings update some previously held assumptions about real-world WebAssembly and highlight problems that call for future research. For example, we show that vulnerabilities that propagate from insecure source languages potentially affect a wide range of binaries (e.g., two thirds of the binaries are compiled from memory unsafe languages, such as C and C++) and that 21\% of all binaries import potentially dangerous APIs from their host environment. We also show that cryptomining, which once accounted for the majority of all WebAssembly code, has been marginalized (less than 1\% of all binaries found on the web) and gives way to a diverse set of use cases. Finally, 29\% of all binaries on the web are minified, calling for techniques to decompile and reverse engineer WebAssembly. Overall, our results show that WebAssembly has left its infancy and is growing up into a language that powers a diverse ecosystem, with new challenges and opportunities for security researchers and practitioners. Besides these insights, we also share the dataset underlying our study, which is 58 times larger than the largest previously reported benchmark.},

  abstract = {Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) typically adapts CPU power consumption by modifying a processor’s operating frequency (and the associated voltage). Typical DVFS approaches include using default strategies such as running at the lowest or the highest frequency or reacting to the CPU’s runtime load to reduce or increase frequency based on the CPU usage. In this article, we argue that a compile-time approach to CPU frequency selection is achievable for affine program regions and can significantly outperform runtime-based approaches. We first propose a lightweight runtime approach that can exploit the properties of the power profile specific to a processor, outperforming classical Linux governors such as powersave or on-demand for computational kernels. We then demonstrate that, for affine kernels in the application, a purely compile-time approach to CPU frequency and core count selection is achievable, providing significant additional benefits over the runtime approach. Our framework relies on a one-time profiling of the target CPU, along with a compile-time categorization of loop-based code segments in the application. These are combined to determine at compile-time the frequency and the number of cores to use to execute each affine region to optimize energy or energy-delay product. Extensive evaluation on 60 benchmarks and 5 multi-core CPUs show that our approach systematically outperforms the powersave Linux governor while also improving overall performance.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing offers utility-oriented IT services to users worldwide. Based on a pay-as-you-go model, it enables hosting of pervasive applications from consumer, scientific, and business domains. However, data centers hosting Cloud applications consume huge amounts of electrical energy, contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. Therefore, we need Green Cloud computing solutions that can not only minimize operational costs but also reduce the environmental impact. In this paper, we define an architectural framework and principles for energy-efficient Cloud computing. Based on this architecture, we present our vision, open research challenges, and resource provisioning and allocation algorithms for energy-efficient management of Cloud computing environments. The proposed energy-aware allocation heuristics provision data center resources to client applications in a way that improves energy efficiency of the data center, while delivering the negotiated Quality of Service (QoS). In particular, in this paper we conduct a survey of research in energy-efficient computing and propose: (a) architectural principles for energy-efficient management of Clouds; (b) energy-efficient resource allocation policies and scheduling algorithms considering QoS expectations and power usage characteristics of the devices; and (c) a number of open research challenges, addressing which can bring substantial benefits to both resource providers and consumers. We have validated our approach by conducting a performance evaluation study using the CloudSim toolkit. The results demonstrate that Cloud computing model has immense potential as it offers significant cost savings and demonstrates high potential for the improvement of energy efficiency under dynamic workload scenarios.},

  abstract = {Docker, a widely adopted tool for packaging and deploying applications leverages Dockerfiles to build images. However, creating an optimal Dockerfile can be challenging, often leading to "Docker smells" or deviations from best practices. This paper presents a study of the impact of 14 Docker smells on the size of Docker images. To assess the size impact of Docker smells, we identified and repaired 16 145 Docker smells from 11 313 open-source Dockerfiles. We observe that the smells result in an average increase of 48.06 MB (4.6\%) per smelly image. Depending on the smell type, the size increase can be up to 10\%, and for some specific cases, the smells can represent 89\% of the image size. Interestingly, the most impactful smells are related to package managers which are commonly encountered and are relatively easy to fix. To collect the perspective of the developers regarding the size impact of the Docker smells, we submitted 34 pull requests that repair the smells and we reported their impact on the Docker image to the developers. 26/34 (76.5\%) of the pull requests have been merged and they contribute to a saving of 3.46 GB (16.4\%). The developer's comments demonstrate a positive interest in addressing those Docker smells even when the pull requests have been rejected},

  abstract = {The serverless computing paradigm promises many desirable properties for cloud applications - low-cost, fine-grained deployment, and management-free operation. Consequently, the paradigm has underwent rapid growth: there currently exist tens of serverless platforms and all global cloud providers host serverless operations. To help tune existing platforms, guide the design of new serverless approaches, and overall contribute to understanding this paradigm, in this work we present a long-term, comprehensive effort to identify, collect, and characterize 89 serverless use cases. We survey use cases, sourced from white and grey literature, and from consultations with experts in areas such as scientific computing. We study each use case using 24 characteristics, including general aspects, but also workload, application, and requirements. When the use cases employ workflows, we further analyze their characteristics. Overall, we hope our study will be useful for both academia and industry, and encourage the community to further share and communicate their use cases.

  abstract = {Recently, academics and the corporate sector have paid attention to serverless computing, which enables dynamic scalability and an economic model. In serverless computing, users pay only for the time they actually spend using the resources. Although zero scaling optimises cost and resource utilisation, it is the fundamental reason for the serverless cold start problem. Various academic and corporate sector studies are being conducted to tackle the cold start problem, which has large research challenges. To study the "cold start" problem in serverless computing, this article provides a comprehensive literature overview of recent research. In addition, we present a detailed taxonomy of several approaches to addressing the issue of cold start latency in serverless computing. Several academic and industrial organisations have proposed methods for cutting down the cold start time and cold start frequency, and this taxonomy is being used to explore these methods. There are several categories in which a current study on cold start latency is organised: caching and application-level optimization-based solutions, as well as AI/ML-based solutions. We have analysed the current methods and grouped them into categories based on their commonalities and features. Finally, we conclude with a review of current challenges and possible future research directions.},

With that, efficiency and security of code on the Web has become more important than ever. Yet JavaScript as the only built-in language of the Web is not well-equipped to meet these requirements, especially as a compilation target.     Engineers from the four major browser vendors have risen to the challenge and collaboratively designed a portable low-level bytecode called WebAssembly. It offers compact representation, efficient validation and compilation, and safe low to no-overhead execution. Rather than committing to a specific programming model, WebAssembly is an abstraction over modern hardware, making it language-, hardware-, and platform-independent, with use cases beyond just the Web. WebAssembly has been designed with a formal semantics from the start. We describe the motivation, design and formal semantics of WebAssembly and provide some preliminary experience with implementations.},

We examine probabilistic energy distributions of instructions and propose a model for composing instruction sequences using distributions, enabling WCEC analysis on program basic blocks. The worst case is predicted with statistical analysis. Further, we verify that the energy of embedded benchmarks can be characterised as a distribution, and compare our proposed technique with other methods of estimating energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Virtualization is often used in cloud computing platforms for its several advantages in efficiently managing resources. However, virtualization raises certain additional challenges, and one of them is lack of power metering for virtual machines (VMs). Power management requirements in modern data centers have led to most new servers providing power usage measurement in hardware and alternate solutions exist for older servers using circuit and outlet level measurements. However, VM power cannot be measured purely in hardware. We present a solution for VM power metering, named Joulemeter. We build power models to infer power consumption from resource usage at runtime and identify the challenges that arise when applying such models for VM power metering. We show how existing instrumentation in server hardware and hypervisors can be used to build the required power models on real platforms with low error. Our approach is designed to operate with extremely low runtime overhead while providing practically useful accuracy. We illustrate the use of the proposed metering capability for VM power capping, a technique to reduce power provisioning costs in data centers. Experiments are performed on server traces from several thousand production servers, hosting Microsoft's real-world applications such as Windows Live Messenger. The results show that not only does VM power metering allows virtualized data centers to achieve the same savings that non-virtualized data centers achieved through physical server power capping, but also that it enables further savings in provisioning costs with virtualization.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing is a commercial and economic paradigm that has gained traction since 2006 and is presently the most significant technology in IT sector. From the notion of cloud computing to its energy efficiency, cloud has been the subject of much discussion. The energy consumption of data centres alone will rise from 200 TWh in 2016 to 2967 TWh in 2030. The data centres require a lot of power to provide services, which increases CO2 emissions. In this survey paper, software-based technologies that can be used for building green data centers and include power management at individual software level has been discussed. The paper discusses the energy efficiency in containers and problem-solving approaches used for reducing power consumption in data centers. Further, the paper also gives details about the impact of data centers on environment that includes the e-waste and the various standards opted by different countries for giving rating to the data centers. This article goes beyond just demonstrating new green cloud computing possibilities. Instead, it focuses the attention and resources of academia and society on a critical issue: long-term technological advancement. The article covers the new technologies that can be applied at the individual software level that includes techniques applied at virtualization level, operating system level and application level. It clearly defines different measures at each level to reduce the energy consumption that clearly adds value to the current environmental problem of pollution reduction. This article also addresses the difficulties, concerns, and needs that cloud data centres and cloud organisations must grasp, as well as some of the factors and case studies that influence green cloud usage.},

  abstract = {Serverless computing has made a significant impact in the cloud computing landscape, and has even been extended beyond the cloud, up to the edge of the network. Existing serverless platforms which use containers and micro virtual machines as function runtimes incur a significant startup latency, hindering the performance and scalability of the executed functions. One potential solution to this problem is the use of WebAssembly. In this paper we discuss recent developments which allow WebAssembly to be used for serverside applications, as well as serverless functions, and evaluate potential orchestration options with the end goal of integrating WebAssembly with existing cloud and edge infrastructure. We conclude that while WebAssembly is a solution to the cold start problem, further work is needed in this area. To realize the endgoal of seamless and user-friendly serverless platforms that can be deployed across the edge-cloud continuum and can dynamically adapt to compute and latency requirements, WebAssembly should not be seen as the exclusive technology, and instead multiple runtime environments should be supported in addition to WebAssembly.},

  abstract = {During the last years, many countries are experiencing rapid expansions in the number and size of data centers to keep pace with their internet and cloud computing needs. High energy consumption of the data center has gradually attracted public attention. However, there are no common efficiency standards governing the design or operation of data centers and the associated air conditioning systems. And the statistical research on air conditioning energy performance is still sorely lacking. This paper presents a summary of 100 data centers air conditioning energy performance. Energy efficiency metrics and benchmarks are also provided so that operators can use these information to track the performance of and identify opportunities to reduce energy use of air conditioning systems in their data centers. The collected data from articles and reports show that the average of HVAC system effectiveness index is 1.44. More than half of the data centers’ air conditioning systems are inefficient. In total, HVAC systems account for about 38\% of facility energy consumption. The range for this usage was 21\% for the most efficient system and 61\% for the least efficient system. Moreover it would be necessary to review some currently available energy efficiency strategies such as economizer cycles, airflow optimization, energy management, and simulations tools.},

  abstract = {The Hypervisor is a collection of software modules that provides virtualization of hardware resources (such as CPU/GPU, Memory, Network and Storage) and thus enables multiple computing stacks (made of an operating system (OS) and Application programs) called Virtual Machines (VMs) to be run on a single physical host. In addition, it may have the functionality to define a network within the single physical host (called virtual network) to enable communication among the VMs resident on that host as well as with physical and virtual machines outside the host. With all this functionality, the hypervisor has the responsibility to mediate access to physical resources, provide run time isolation among resident VMs and enable a virtual network that provides security-preserving communication flow among the VMs and between the VMs and the external network. The architecture of a hypervisor can be classified in different ways. The security recommendations in this document relate to ensuring the secure execution of baseline functions of the hypervisor and are therefore agnostic to the hypervisor architecture. Further, the recommendations are in the context of a hypervisor deployed for server virtualization and not for other use cases such as embedded systems and desktops. Recommendations for secure configuration of a virtual network are dealt with in a separate NIST document (Special Publication 800-125B).},

  abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and the success of resource-rich cloud services have pushed the data processing horizon towards the edge of the network. This has the potential to address bandwidth costs, and latency, availability and data privacy concerns. Serverless computing, a cloud computing model for stateless and event-driven applications, promises to further improve Quality of Service (QoS) by eliminating the burden of always-on infrastructure through ephemeral containers. Open source serverless frameworks have been introduced to avoid the vendor lock-in and computation restrictions of public cloud platforms and to bring the power of serverless computing to onpremises deployments. In an IoT environment, these frameworks can leverage the computational capabilities of devices in the local network to further improve QoS of applications delivered to the user. However, these frameworks have not been evaluated in a resource-constrained, edge computing environment. In this work we evaluate four open source serverless frameworks, namely, Kubeless, Apache OpenWhisk, OpenFaaS, Knative. Each framework is installed on a bare-metal, single master, Kubernetes cluster. We use the JMeter framework to evaluate the response time, throughput and success rate of functions deployed using these frameworks under different workloads. The evaluation results are presented and open research opportunities are discussed.},

Organizations that are keen to leverage modern technology to gain a disruptive edge, optimal efficiency, advanced agility and save cost are adopting these architectural styles rapidly. Cloud service provider offer and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources in serverless computing. The serverless architectures allows the developers to focus on business logic exclusively without worrying about preparing the runtime, managing deployment and infrastructure related concerns. FaaS may be assumed as a subset of Serverless Computing, in which, instead of coding a full-fledged cloud based application, the developer just writes (often small) functions which are piece of code (in one of the multiple programming languages supported by the platform) dedicated to do a focused, often single task that are invoked by triggers. It offers dynamic allocation and scaling of the resources and innovative trigger based costing model. This paper introduces Serverless Computing, and Function as a Service (FaaS), explores its advantages and limitations, options available with popular cloud and Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers, and emerging use cases and success stories.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing is a way to increase the capacity or add capabilities dynamically without investing in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. It extends Information Technology’s (IT) existing capabilities. In the last few years, cloud computing has grown from being a promising business concept to one of the fast growing segments of the IT industry. But as more and more information on individuals and companies are placed in the cloud, concerns are beginning to grow about just how safe an environment it is. Despite of all the hype surrounding the cloud, enterprise customers are still reluctant to deploy their business in the cloud. Security is one of the major issues which reduces the growth of cloud computing and complications with data privacy and data protection continue to plague the market. The advent of an advanced model should not negotiate with the required functionalities and capabilities present in the current model. A new model targeting at improving features of an existing model must not risk or threaten other important features of the current model. The architecture of cloud poses such a threat to the security of the existing technologies when deployed in a cloud environment. Cloud service users need to be vigilant in understanding the risks of data breaches in this new environment. In this paper, a survey of the different security risks that pose a threat to the cloud is presented. This paper is a survey more specific to the different security issues that has emanated due to the nature of the service delivery models of a cloud computing system.},

One analysis job can take days and process tens of millions of collisions. Today the experiments of the large hadron collider (LHC) create 10 GB of data per second and a future upgrade will cause a ten-fold increase in data. The data analysis requires not only massive hardware but also a lot of electricity. In this article, we discuss energy efficiency in scientific computing and review a set of intermixed approaches we have developed in our Green Big Data project to improve energy efficiency of CERN computing. These approaches include making energy consumption visible to developers and users, architectural improvements, smarter management of computing jobs, and benefits of cloud technologies. The open and innovative environment at CERN is an excellent playground for different energy efficiency ideas which can later find use in mainstream computing. We show how energy efficiency is a large challenge in scientific computing at CERN.Making energy consumption visible for stakeholders motivates improving energy efficiency.Energy efficiency can be improved by applying operations management methodology.},

With a huge amount of genetic variations data in hand, developing efficient algorithms to carry out the gene–gene interaction analysis in a timely manner has become one of the key problems in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Boolean operation-based screening and testing (BOOST), a recent work in GWAS, completes gene–gene interaction analysis in 2.5 days on a desktop computer. Compared with central processing units (CPUs), graphic processing units (GPUs) are highly parallel hardware and provide massive computing resources. We are, therefore, motivated to use GPUs to further speed up the analysis of gene–gene interactions. Results: We implement the BOOST method based on a GPU framework and name it GBOOST. GBOOST achieves a 40-fold speedup compared with BOOST. It completes the analysis of Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium Type 2 Diabetes (WTCCC T2D) genome data within 1.34 h on a desktop computer equipped with Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 display card.
