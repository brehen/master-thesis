  abstract = {WebAssembly has emerged as a low-level language for the web and beyond. Despite its popularity in different domains, little is known about WebAssembly binaries that occur in the wild. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of 8,461 unique WebAssembly binaries gathered from a wide range of sources, including source code repositories, package managers, and live websites. We study the security properties, source languages, and use cases of the binaries and how they influence the security of the WebAssembly ecosystem. Our findings update some previously held assumptions about real-world WebAssembly and highlight problems that call for future research. For example, we show that vulnerabilities that propagate from insecure source languages potentially affect a wide range of binaries (e.g., two thirds of the binaries are compiled from memory unsafe languages, such as C and C++) and that 21\% of all binaries import potentially dangerous APIs from their host environment. We also show that cryptomining, which once accounted for the majority of all WebAssembly code, has been marginalized (less than 1\% of all binaries found on the web) and gives way to a diverse set of use cases. Finally, 29\% of all binaries on the web are minified, calling for techniques to decompile and reverse engineer WebAssembly. Overall, our results show that WebAssembly has left its infancy and is growing up into a language that powers a diverse ecosystem, with new challenges and opportunities for security researchers and practitioners. Besides these insights, we also share the dataset underlying our study, which is 58 times larger than the largest previously reported benchmark.},

  abstract = {Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) typically adapts CPU power consumption by modifying a processor's operating frequency (and the associated voltage). Typical DVFS approaches include using default strategies such as running at the lowest or the highest frequency or reacting to the CPU's runtime load to reduce or increase frequency based on the CPU usage. In this article, we argue that a compile-time approach to CPU frequency selection is achievable for affine program regions and can significantly outperform runtime-based approaches. We first propose a lightweight runtime approach that can exploit the properties of the power profile specific to a processor, outperforming classical Linux governors such as powersave or on-demand for computational kernels. We then demonstrate that, for affine kernels in the application, a purely compile-time approach to CPU frequency and core count selection is achievable, providing significant additional benefits over the runtime approach. Our framework relies on a one-time profiling of the target CPU, along with a compile-time categorization of loop-based code segments in the application. These are combined to determine at compile-time the frequency and the number of cores to use to execute each affine region to optimize energy or energy-delay product. Extensive evaluation on 60 benchmarks and 5 multi-core CPUs show that our approach systematically outperforms the powersave Linux governor while also improving overall performance.},

To achieve faster delivery of resources and applications to strengthen the business with more transformations containers have been introduced. At the existing scenario, the hyper-converged data centre uses the concept of virtualization which creates software abstraction of the underlying hardware using Hypervisor software that enables to execute several Virtual Machines (VMs) with dissimilar Operating System (OS) flavours. But virtualization is heavyweight and it may take more time to boot. The proposed containerization and docker in hybrid cloud composable data centre is lightweight supports Operating System (OS) level virtualization that isolates resources, libraries and other binaries bundled into a single package for agile modern scalable workloads. This paper focuses on the container-based virtualization to shape the future cloud-based modern data centre for supporting the micro-services based applications for faster deployment to Developer Operations (DevOps) teams in IT with resiliency, High Availability and better resource management with energy savings.},

  abstract = {Docker, a widely adopted tool for packaging and deploying applications leverages Dockerfiles to build images. However, creating an optimal Dockerfile can be challenging, often leading to "Docker smells" or deviations from best practices. This paper presents a study of the impact of 14 Docker smells on the size of Docker images. To assess the size impact of Docker smells, we identified and repaired 16 145 Docker smells from 11 313 open-source Dockerfiles. We observe that the smells result in an average increase of 48.06 MB (4.6\%) per smelly image. Depending on the smell type, the size increase can be up to 10\%, and for some specific cases, the smells can represent 89\% of the image size. Interestingly, the most impactful smells are related to package managers which are commonly encountered and are relatively easy to fix. To collect the perspective of the developers regarding the size impact of the Docker smells, we submitted 34 pull requests that repair the smells and we reported their impact on the Docker image to the developers. 26/34 (76.5\%) of the pull requests have been merged and they contribute to a saving of 3.46 GB (16.4\%). The developer's comments demonstrate a positive interest in addressing those Docker smells even when the pull requests have been rejected},

With that, efficiency and security of code on the Web has become more important than ever. Yet JavaScript as the only built-in language of the Web is not well-equipped to meet these requirements, especially as a compilation target.     Engineers from the four major browser vendors have risen to the challenge and collaboratively designed a portable low-level bytecode called WebAssembly. It offers compact representation, efficient validation and compilation, and safe low to no-overhead execution. Rather than committing to a specific programming model, WebAssembly is an abstraction over modern hardware, making it language-, hardware-, and platform-independent, with use cases beyond just the Web. WebAssembly has been designed with a formal semantics from the start. We describe the motivation, design and formal semantics of WebAssembly and provide some preliminary experience with implementations.},

We investigate the impact of instruction operand values upon energy consumption in cacheless embedded processors.

We examine probabilistic energy distributions of instructions and propose a model for composing instruction sequences using distributions, enabling WCEC analysis on program basic blocks. The worst case is predicted with statistical analysis. Further, we verify that the energy of embedded benchmarks can be characterised as a distribution, and compare our proposed technique with other methods of estimating energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Virtualization is often used in cloud computing platforms for its several advantages in efficiently managing resources. However, virtualization raises certain additional challenges, and one of them is lack of power metering for virtual machines (VMs). Power management requirements in modern data centers have led to most new servers providing power usage measurement in hardware and alternate solutions exist for older servers using circuit and outlet level measurements. However, VM power cannot be measured purely in hardware. We present a solution for VM power metering, named Joulemeter. We build power models to infer power consumption from resource usage at runtime and identify the challenges that arise when applying such models for VM power metering. We show how existing instrumentation in server hardware and hypervisors can be used to build the required power models on real platforms with low error. Our approach is designed to operate with extremely low runtime overhead while providing practically useful accuracy. We illustrate the use of the proposed metering capability for VM power capping, a technique to reduce power provisioning costs in data centers. Experiments are performed on server traces from several thousand production servers, hosting Microsoft's real-world applications such as Windows Live Messenger. The results show that not only does VM power metering allows virtualized data centers to achieve the same savings that non-virtualized data centers achieved through physical server power capping, but also that it enables further savings in provisioning costs with virtualization.},

One analysis job can take days and process tens of millions of collisions. Today the experiments of the large hadron collider (LHC) create 10 GB of data per second and a future upgrade will cause a ten-fold increase in data. The data analysis requires not only massive hardware but also a lot of electricity. In this article, we discuss energy efficiency in scientific computing and review a set of intermixed approaches we have developed in our Green Big Data project to improve energy efficiency of CERN computing. These approaches include making energy consumption visible to developers and users, architectural improvements, smarter management of computing jobs, and benefits of cloud technologies. The open and innovative environment at CERN is an excellent playground for different energy efficiency ideas which can later find use in mainstream computing. We show how energy efficiency is a large challenge in scientific computing at CERN.Making energy consumption visible for stakeholders motivates improving energy efficiency.Energy efficiency can be improved by applying operations management methodology.},

With a huge amount of genetic variations data in hand, developing efficient algorithms to carry out the gene--gene interaction analysis in a timely manner has become one of the key problems in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Boolean operation-based screening and testing (BOOST), a recent work in GWAS, completes gene--gene interaction analysis in 2.5 days on a desktop computer. Compared with central processing units (CPUs), graphic processing units (GPUs) are highly parallel hardware and provide massive computing resources. We are, therefore, motivated to use GPUs to further speed up the analysis of gene--gene interactions. Results: We implement the BOOST method based on a GPU framework and name it GBOOST. GBOOST achieves a 40-fold speedup compared with BOOST. It completes the analysis of Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium Type 2 Diabetes (WTCCC T2D) genome data within 1.34 h on a desktop computer equipped with Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 display card.
