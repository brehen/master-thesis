\chapter*{Abstract}

The ever increasing demand for cloud services has resulted in the expansion of
energy-intensive data centers, the ICT industry accounts for about 1 \% of global 
electricity use, highlighting a need for sustainable options
in cloud computing architectures.

\vspace{0.25cm}

This thesis investigates WebAssembly, a technology originally intended for running 
in the browser, as a potential contender in the space of technologies to
consider in cloud native applications. Leveraging the inherent efficiency,
portability and lower startup times of WebAssembly modules, this thesis presents an
approach that aligns with green energy principles, while maintaining performance and
scalability, essential for cloud services.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

In the digital age \citep{freitag2021}, cloud computing has emerged as a foundational technology in
the technological landscape, driving innovation and increased efficiency across
various sectors. Its growth over the past decade has not only transformed how
consumers store, process, and access data, but also raised environmental
concerns. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry, with
cloud computing at its core, accounts for an estimated 2.1\% to 3.9\% of global
greenhouse gas emissions. Data centers, the backbone of cloud
computing infrastructures are responsible for about 200 TWh/yr, or about 1\% of
the global electricity consumption, a figure projected to escalate, potentially
reaching 15\% to 30\% of electricity consumption in some countries by 2030
\citep{freitag2021}.

The sustainability of cloud computing is thus under scrutiny, and while some
vendors strive to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint for their cloud computing
services, many data centers still rely on electricity generated by fossil fuels,
a leading contributor to climate change \citep{mytton2020}. This reality
underscores an urgent need to explore alternative technologies that promise
enhanced energy efficiency while meeting customers demands. In this vein,
serverless computing has emerged as a compelling paradigm, offering scalability
and flexibility by enabling functions to execute in response to requests, rather
than having a server running all the time. However, the inherent startup latency
associated with containerized serverless functions pose a challenge,
particularly for on-demand applications.


This thesis proposes exploring WebAssembly with WebAssembly System Interface
(WASI) as an innovative choice for deploying functions to the cloud, through
developing a prototype Functions-as-a-Service platform named Nebula. This
platform will run functions compiled to WebAssembly, originally designed for
high-performance tasks in web browsers, which coupled with WASI, allows us to
give WebAssembly programs access to the underlying system. This holds potential
for a more efficient way to package and deploy functions, potentially reducing
the startup latency and the overhead associated with traditional serverless
platforms. WebAssembly and WASI offers a pathway where the demands of today is
met, while reducing the carbon footprint for cloud applications.

<!--
It is important to note is that these measurements and estimates comes with a
certain level of uncertainty, yet they offer a glimpse into the current and
future challenges of cloud computing's energy consumption. As demand for cloud
services continues to rise, there is a pressing need to explore alternative
technologies that can enhance energy efficiency without compromising on the
performance, availability and scalability of that the users expect.

In Norway, for example, Google is in the process of constructing a data center
in Skien, expected to be fully operational by 2026. This facility alone is
estimated to require 7.5TWh/yr, amounting to 25% of Google's total power
consumption world wide.(TODO: SRC) Google has commited to powering this data
center entirely with renewable energy, aiming for a net-zero carbon footprint.
However, this commitment is not universally adopted, and many data centers still
rely on electricity generated by fossil fuels, a leading contributor to climate
change 

One prevalent method for building cloud applications today involves using
serverless computing platforms, such as Amazon's *AWS Lambdas*, or Google's
*Cloud Functions*. These platforms let developers deploy code into containers
executed upon request. Despite the benefits, such as the ability to run software
across different architectures, this approach introduces a startup latency for
the containers. This latency is negligible for long-running services, but
significant for on-demand functions. 

This thesis proposes exploring WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface
(WASI) as innovative choices for deploying functions to public cloud services.
WebAssembly, originally developed for efficient execution in web browsers,
combined with WASI, enables WebAssembly to run on servers, potentially offering
a more efficient way to package and deploy functions.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sect:motivation}

The environmental footprint of cloud computing, particularly the energy demands
of data centers, is a pressing issue. As the digital landscape continues to
evolve, the quest for sustainable solutions has never been more critical. This
thesis is motivated by the need to reconcile the growing demand for cloud
services with the pressing need for environmental sustainability. Through the
lens of WebAssembly and WASI, this thesis aims to investigate innovative
deployment methods that promise to reduce energy consumption without sacrificing
performance, thereby contributing to the development of a more sustainable cloud
computing ecosystem.


\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sect:problems}

This thesis focuses on two primary objectives:

1. Assessing the potential for optimizing cloud service deployments using
   WebAssembly, with an eye towards the trade-offs in energy consumption
   associated with different deployment strategies.
2. Evaluate the potential energy savings and potential performance gains by
   employing WebAssembly for function execution in cloud environments.

By addressing these objectives, this thesis seeks to shed light on the feasibility
and implications of adopting WebAssembly and WASI for a more energy-efficient
cloud computing world.

\section{Outline}

The thesis has five chapters; this introduction, a chapter that goes
through the background for how cloud computing got to this point, a chapter
dedicated to the process of building Nebula, a chapter for discussing the
results from the experiments, and ending with a chapter suggesting future works.

\chapter{Three waves of cloud compute}

\setlength\epigraphwidth{.35\textwidth}

\epigraph{\itshape 
9 out of 10 cloud providers hate this one simple trick.
}{Joachim, my supervisor}

The evolution of cloud computing represents a transformative adventure, driven by
the pursuit for efficiency, scalability and reliability, yet it also
poses challenges, notably it's environmental impact. This chapter steps through this
adventure by introducing the concept of the "Three waves of cloud computing", coined
by the WebAssembly community \citep*{butcherDodds2024}. Where the two first waves of
cloud compute represent the shit from Virtual Machines to Containerization, the
third wave encompasses utilizing WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System
Interface (WASI) to build the next era of cloud compute with the potential to
significantly reduce the carbon footprint.

\section{Ashore: Before the waves}

Before delving into the waves themselves, it's essential to understand the
landscape that preceded cloud computing. Prior to the cloud era, companies were
required to building and mantaining their digital services in-house. This
required companies to invest heavily into both expensive hardware and expensive
engineers to buy, upkeep and oversee their own physical servers and network
hardware. (See figure \ref{myspeis} for an example)


\begin{figure}[H]
\label{myspeis}
\centering
  \includegraphics{assets/2.1-before-the-waves.jpg}
  \caption{Example of a company that host their own infrastructure.}
\end{figure}

This sort of setup mandates a significant upfront costs involved in setting up and
maintaining such an infrastructure, which puts a considerable financial strain
on organizations, and kept smaller companies that were unable to invest in this,
at an disadvantage. 

As a response to this, some companies found a market for taking on the
responsibility of managing infrastructure, and offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service
(IaaS) services to an evolving ecosystem of companies with a digital landscape.
On these managed infrastructures companies could deploy their services on top of
Virtual machines that allowed more flexibility, and lowered the bar to new
companies.

\section{The First Wave: Virtual Machines}

The start of cloud computing can be traced back to the emergence of
virtualization, more specifically virtual machines, a response to the costly and
complex nature of managing traditional, on-premise data centers. During the
mid-2000s, Amazon launched its subsidiary, Amazon Web Services (AWS), who in
turn launched Amazon S3 in March 2006, followed by Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
in August the same year \citep{barrAmazonEC2Beta2006}. With these services, AWS positioned
itself as a pioneer in this space, marking a major turning point in application
development and deployment, and popularized cloud computing. EC2, as an
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform, empowered developers to run virtual
machines remotely. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\label{feisbook}
\centering
  \includegraphics{assets/2.2-first-wave.jpg}
  \caption{Example of "Feisbook" building their services on EC2}
\end{figure}

While similar services existed before 2006, with Amazon's existing large
customer base helped them gain significant traction, and ushered in a the first
era, or wave, of *cloud computing*.

\section{The Second Wave: Containerization}

As we entered the 2010s, the focus shifted from Virtual Machines to containers,
largely due to the limitations of VMs in efficiency, resource utilization, and
application deployment speed. Containers, being a lightweight alternative to
VMs, designed to overcome these hurdles \citep{bao2016}. 

In contrast to VMs, which require installation of resource-intensive operating
systems and minutes to start up, containers along with their required OS
components, could start up in seconds. Typically managed by orchestration tools
like Kubernetes ^[https://kubernetes.io], containers enabled applications to package alongside
their required OS components, facilitating scalability in response to varying
service loads. Consequently, an increasing number of companies have since
established platform teams to build orchestrated developers platforms, thereby
simplifying application development in Kubernetes clusters.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics{assets/2.3-second-wave-ill.jpg}
  \caption{DevOps engineer deploying services as containers on AWS}
\end{figure}

Containers are not a perfect solution however, and while they simplify the means
of developing and deploying applications, docker images can easily reach
Gigabytes in image size \citep{durieux2023}, and can take a long time to start up.
These solutions are more efficient than manually installing an operating system
on a machine, but they still have leave a large footprint, is there a more
efficient way to package and deploy our programs? Maybe WebAssembly and
WebAssembly System Interface, as mentioned in epigraph of this thesis can pose a
promising alternative?

\section{The Third Wave: WebAssembly}

WebAssembly has had a surge of popularity the past three to four years when
developers discovered that what it was designed for - to truly run safely
inside the browser - translated well into a cloud native environment as well.
Containers has had a positive shift on the cloud native landscape as a whole,
but while a lot better than the previous iterations of cloud applications, some
shortcomings remain. The image sizes can get quite large, starting up a docker
image can be a costly affair, and the abstraction layer between the underlying
computer and the code running in the container increases the resources required
to run programs.

WebAssembly is a compilation target with many languages adopting support, and by
itself, it is sandboxed to run in a WebAssembly VM without access to the outside
world, meaning that it can't access the underlying system. This means that a
"vanilla" WebAssembly module can't write to the file system, update a Redis
cache or transmit a POST request to another service. 

To enable this, the WebAssembly System Interface project was birthed. This
project allows developers to write code that compiles to WebAssembly that
can access the underlying system. This is the key project that turned many
developers onto the path of exploring WebAssembly as a potential contender for
building cloud applications. With WebAssembly, developers can write programs in
a programming language that supports it as a compilation target, and build tiny
modules that can run on a WebAssembly runtime. These WebAssembly runtimes can
run on pretty much any architecture with ease, the resulting binary size are
quite small, and the performance is near-native. These perks combined with the
potential for reduced overhead, smaller image sizes, and faster startup times
make WebAssembly and WASI a promising candidate for the third wave of cloud
compute with a lower impact on the environment.

In summary, the three waves of cloud computing - virtual machines, containers,
and now WebAssembly with WASI - represent the industry's pursuit of more
efficient, scalable and reliable solutions for building cloud applications.
While each wave has attempted to tackle pressing challenges of its time, it's
exciting to see how WebAssembly and WASI can be leveraged in this third wave and
see if it's promise of more efficient applications can lead to reducing the
environmental impact of ICT.

Data has gravity, and that gravity pulls hard
}{David Flanagan}
\section{Cloud Computing Overview}

Cloud computing, more commonly known as "*the cloud*", refers to the delivery of
computing resources served over the internet, instead of running on locally owned hardware
(on-premise). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines
Cloud computing like so: 


\begin{tcolorbox}[
  definitionstyle,
  title=NIST definition of Cloud Computing,
]
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
network access to a shared pool of configurable computing re- sources (e.g.,
networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider
interaction.

\end{tcolorbox}

The foundations required for this paradigm can be traced back to the early
1960s, when projects like the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) at MIT
demonstrated the potential for multiple users to access and share computing
resources simultaneously \citep{crisman1963}. While CTSS was a localized system,
it paved the way for the concept of shared computing resources, a fundamental
principle of cloud computing.

During the following decades, advancements in networking, virtualization and the
popularity of the internet led to the development of more advanced systems that
allowed remote access to shared computing resources, ultimately culminating in
the modern cloud computing paradigm. 

Modern cloud computing saw its emergence in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and
while the first usage of the term *Cloud computing* can be traced back to Compaq
in 1996 \citep{favaloroInternetSolutionsDivision1996}, it was companies like Amazon and
Salesforce that brought the cloud to the masses in the late 2000s. The launch of
Amazon Web Services in 2006 marks the point when cloud computing started gaining
traction.

For many companies, the cloud has proved to be a super power, where companies
can focus on deploying their own applications and services to their users
without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Some of these benefits
include:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Cloud Computing Benefits}

Accessibility & Cloud computing enables companies to serve their services to
anyone that can connect to the internet, enabling consumers to access services
with greater freedom. \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{table:benefits}
\end{table}

However, in the field of ICT, one truth prevails: the inevitability of trade-offs. Every
decision in software engineering involves weighing different factors against
each other, such as performance against simplicity, or between speed of delivery
and robustness \citep{lelekSoftwareMistakesTradeoffs2022}. This rings especially true in the world of
cloud computing where, depending on the scale of your company, the way you set
up your services on the cloud can have large implications. Some of these
trade-offs include:

\section{Virtualization and Container}

\subsection{Virtual Machines}
\subsection{Containers and Docker}
\subsection{Container orchestration}

\section{Serverless Computing}

Building your own developer platform on top of Kubernetes, much like building
your own infrastructure, also entails a significant cost. Often, developers wish
to launch specialized smaller services, without having to grapple with
complicated orchestration. This led to the emergence of the Serverless model.
Despite its somewhat misleading name, serverless doesn't imply the absence of a
server. Instead, it means that the responsibility of server management has
shifted from the developer to a third party provider.

From the advancements of serverless, we get its subset, Functions-as-a-Service,
or FaaS. Companies already in the cloud game decided to develop their own FaaS
platforms to attract developers interested in just writing their functions and
running them, and not worry about anything underneath.

\subsection{Major vendors in Serverless}

The concept of "the cloud" isn't owned by any single organization, but rather,
through the collective effort of industry players including Amazon, Microsoft,
Google, Alibaba and DigitalOcean, among others. This essay delves into some
challenges faced by the biggest three vendors: Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides [AWS Lambdas][11], a technology that hinges
on their proprietary Firecracker - a streamlined virtualization technology for
executing functions. Interestingly, for this thesis, is that Amazon's Prime
Video streaming service transitioned recently from a serverless architecture to
a monolithic system to meet specific service demands. One might question whether
this reflects the suitability of serverless systems for cloud computing, or for
specific use cases like theirs [(Kolny, M. 2023. Accessed 29.05.23)][12]. Some
discussions suggest that their need to process videos frame by frame led to
astronomical costs on their sibling company's FaaS, Amazon Lambda.

Google provides [Google Cloud Functions][13], which allow developers to write
and execute functions in languages such as Node.js, Python, Go and execute them
in response to events. Google's approach to function execution centeres around
container technology [(Wayner, P. 2018. Accessed 29.05.23)][14].

Microsoft's [Azure Functions][15] is a Faas platform that enables developers to
create and execute functions written in languages like C#, JavaScript, Python.
Similar to Google, they also harness the power of containers to execute these
functions.

\section{WebAssembly and WASI}

WebAssembly, originally designed for running demanding computations in web
browsers, present a promising technology that could help reduce the energy
consumption of cloud services. It offers an interesting option for packaging
functions with its compact binary format and fast execution time. This has the
potiential to significantly reduce startup latency and resource overhead
associated with traditional serverless platforms. This increased efficiency
could lead to a direct decrease in energy consumption for cloud services, which
in turn could motivate the industry to adopt alternative technology that enable
a more sustainable cloud.

\subsection{WebAssembly}

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed as a stack-based
virtual machine. It aims to be a portable target for the compilation of
high-level languages like Rust, C++, Go and many others, enabling deployment on
the web for client and server applications. Originally designed and developed to
complement JavaScript in the browser, it now expands its scope to server-side
applications, thanks to projects like WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), which
provides a standarized interface for WebAssembly modules to interface with a
system.

WebAssembly's design provides advantages over traditional deployments methods in
the context of cloud native applications:

_Efficiency and Speed_: Wasm was designed to be fast, enabling near-native
performance. Its binary format is compact and designed for quick decoding,
contributing to quicker startup times, an important aspect for server-side
applications. The performance gains could lead to less CPU usage, thereby
improving energy efficiency.

_Safety and Security_: WebAssembly is designed to be safe and sandboxed. Each
WebAssembly module executes within a confined environment without direct access
to the host system's resources. This isolation of processes is inherent in
WebAssembly's design, promoting secure practices.

_Portability_: WebAssembly's platform-agnostic design makes it highly portable.
It can run across a variety of different system architectures. For cloud native
applications, this means WebAssembly modules, once compiled, can run anywhere -
from the edge to the server, irrespective of the environment.

_Language Support_: A large amount of programming langauages can already target
WebAssembly. This means developers are not restricted to a particular language
when developing applications intended to be deployed as WebAssembly modules.
This provides greater flexibility to leverage the most suitable languages for
particular tasks.

In contrast, traditional methods such as deployment with containers or VMs can
be resource-intensive, slower to boot up, less secure due to a larger surface
attack area, and less efficient. Given these, WebAssembly, with its efficiency,
security, and portability, can potentially offer an attractive alternative
deployment method for building and running cloud native applications, like the
"Academemes" service we will explore in this essay.

\subsection{WebAssembly System Interface}

WebAssembly (WASM) and [WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)][16] present
promising choices to traditional ways of deploying and hosting Function as
a Service (FaaS) platforms, offering several notable advantages, in
terms of startup times and energy efficiency.

_Reduced Startup Times_: One of the greatest strengths of Wasm is its compact
binary format designed for quick decoding and efficient execution. It offers
near-native performance, which results in significantly reduced startup times
compared to container-based or VM-based solutions. In a FaaS context, where
functions need to spin up rapidly in response to events, this attribute is
particularly advantageous. This not only contributes to the overall performance
but also improves the user experience, as the latency associated with function
initialization is minimized.

_Improved Energy Efficiency_: Wasm's efficiency extends to energy use as well.
Thanks to its optimized execution, Wasm can accomplish the same tasks as
traditional cloud applications but with less computational effort. The CPU
doesn't need to work as hard, which results in less energy consumed. With data
centers being responsible for a significant portion of global energy consumption
and carbon emissions, adopting Wasm could lead to substantial energy savings and
environmental benefits.

_Scalability_: Wasm's small footprint and fast startup times make it an
excellent fit for highly scalable cloud applications. Its efficiency means it
can handle many more requests within the same hardware resources, hence reducing
the need for additional servers and thus reducing the energy footprint further.

_Portability and Flexibility_: WASI extends the portability of Wasm outside the
browser environment, making it possible to run Wasm modules securely on any
WASI-compatible runtime. This means that FaaS platforms can run these modules on
any hardware, operating system, or cloud provider that supports WASI. This
portability ensures flexibility and mitigates the risk of vendor lock-in.

While runtime efficiency is an important aspect and typically a strength of
Wasm, it might not be the primary focus of this thesis. That being said, it is
worth mentioning that the efficient execution of Wasm modules does contribute to
the overall operational efficiency and energy savings of Wasm-based FaaS
platforms.

In summary, introducing WASM+WASI as a component for deploying and hosting FaaS
platforms can offer significant benefits. Focusing on energy efficiency and reduced startup times, this approach could pave the way for more sustainable,
efficient, and responsive cloud services. In the context of our "Academemes"
service, this could lead to a scalable, performant, and environmentally friendly
platform.

\chapter{Approach}

To investigate the problem statements posed in \autoref{sect:problems}, roughly
summarized to exploring if WebAssembly and WebAssembly System Interface can lead
to a more efficient and energysaving way to build our cloud services, an
exploratory approach will be used. Different benchmarking experiments will be
run against a prototype developed for this thesis, where different functions can
be invoked with different inputs and reveal startup and runtimes of invoking
functions compiled to WebAssembly modules and compare these with functions
packaged as Docker images.
