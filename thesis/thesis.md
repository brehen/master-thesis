## Introduction

Introduce the research problem and its significance. Present the main hypothesis
of the thesis. Provide an overview of the thesis structure.

## Background

### Cloud Computing: An Overview

### Traditional Deployment Methods: Virtual Machines and Containers

### Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

### WebAssembly: A New Paradigm

### Hypothesis Revisited

## Methodology

- Explain the choice of Rust and WebAssembly for building a prototype FaaS
  platform.
- Describe the design and implementation of the prototype FaaS platform,
  focusing on the restrictions that allow only Wasm-compiled functions.
- Detail the experimental setup, including hardware, software, and tools used.
- Outline the performance metrics and evaluation criteria for measuring the
  success of the FaaS platform.

## Results

- Present the results of the experiments conducted using the prototype FaaS
  platform.
- Analyze the performance of the FaaS platform in terms of scalability,
  availability, and energy efficiency.
- Compare the results with those of traditional deployment methods, such as VMs
  and Containers.

## Discussion

- Interpret the results in the context of the main hypothesis.
- Discuss the implications of the findings for cloud computing and web service
  deployment.
- Identify the strengths and limitations of the prototype FaaS platform and the
  experiments conducted.
- Suggest future research directions and potential improvements to the FaaS
  platform.

## Conclusion

- Summarize the main findings and their implications.
- Reiterate the contributions of the thesis to the field of cloud computing and
  energy efficiency. -Provide final thoughts and reflections on the research.

## References

- List all sources cited throughout the thesis, following a consistent citation
  style.

## Appendices

- Include any supplementary material, such as code listings, experimental data,
  or additional figures and tables.
